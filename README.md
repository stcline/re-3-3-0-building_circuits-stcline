# :robot: Building Circuits

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 

In a previous lab, you created a schematic from three different circuts.  In this example you will practice building circuits from a schematic, including debugging a circuit. üöÄ

## Background Practice

Before constructing a circuit, read the [Section 3.3](https://roboticsengineeringcourse.github.io/electrical-concepts.html#circuits) of our online text.  Be sure to read over the page from the All About Circuits textbook and complete at least questions 1-5 on the worksheet.  That should give you plenty of background along with what you learned in [Section 3.1](https://roboticsengineeringcourse.github.io/electrical-concepts.html#schematics) about schematics.

## Circuit Practice

1. Download the file in this repo called "circuit-RE-3.3.0.txt" and open it with [Circuit Simulator](https://thumbsdb.herokuapp.com/circuit/).  This circuit is incomplete.  
2. Fix it so that the cirtuit works and all three LEDs light up.  
3. Build the circuit on your breadboard.

## üíª Terms to know

- Conductors
- Insulators
- Closed Circuit
- Broken (Open) Circuit

## üìù Next steps

1. Save the circuit as a txt file and upload it to this repo as "fixed-circuit-RE-3.3.0.txt".  
2. Create a markdown file in this repo called "results.md".  Describe why the original circuit did not work and what you had to do to fix it.
3. Take a photo of the circuit on your breadboard and insert it into the results.md file.
